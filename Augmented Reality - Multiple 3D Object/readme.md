### Multiple Targets

This example shows how to recognize and track multiple images simultaneously. Furthermore it shows how to use distance, translation and rotation between the tracked images.

For a better understanding it is recommended to read the documentation of Image Recognition and 3D Models first.

Please use the following image on this page to test the sample. It is recommended to print the image and cut out the different cards to see the interaction between the dinosaurs.
